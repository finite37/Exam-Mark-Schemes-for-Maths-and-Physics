    \vspace{12pt}

    This can be intuited by the fact if \(P_2\) drops by \(\delta x\) then to ``fill'' the dropped distance with string it would require \(2\delta x\) of string whilst if \(m_1\) were to move to the left by \(\delta x\) then the ``lost'' string would only be \(\delta x\).
    
    \vspace{12pt}

    Here is the mathematical argument:

    \vspace{12pt}

    Let the total length of the string from a datum be \(l\) then we can express \(l\) as:

    \[l=2x_{p_2}+x_{m_1}+\frac{3}{4}\pi r,\]

    
    where \(x_{p_2}\) is the distance from the datum to \(P_2\)'s left most touch with the string and \(x_{m_1}\) is the distance from the \(P_1\)'s top most touch with the string to \(m_1\) hence by differentiating we get:

    \[0=2v_{p_2}+v_{m_1},\]

    and again:

    \[0=2a_{p_2}+a_{m_1},\]

    where each symbol has its obvious meaning.

    Hence it can be concluded:

    \[2|a_{m_2}|=|a_{m_1}|.\]

    where \(a_{m_2}\) is the acceleration of \(m_2\) as \(m_2\) is a constant displacement from \(P_2\).

    \vspace{12pt}

    ii.

    \vspace{12pt}

    Since \(P_2\) doesn't slip on the left vertical string and is accellerating downwards like \(m_2\) then it must have a rotational acceleration clockwise (the right veritcal string moves so this doesn't apply to the right string), also as \(P_2\) doesn't slip then the tangential acceleration that \(P_2\) falls with at its edge (a distance of \(R\) from its centre) is equal to \(a/2\) where \(a/2\) is it's downwards acceleration and is half \(a\), the magnitude of the acceleration of \(m_1\), by part i. Now for \(P_1\), the string which runs over \(P_1\) is accelearting to the left with an acceleartion \(a\) which is given by the fact that the string is in tension and \(m_1\) is accelearting at \(a\) hence the tangential acceleration at the edge of \(P_1\) is a \(a\) and its rotational acceleration is anticlockwise, thus opposite to the rotational acceleration of \(P_2\). Hence it can be concluded that magnitudes of \(P_1\)'s and \(P_2\)'s rotational acceleration: \(\alpha_{P_1}\), \(\alpha_{P_2}\), respectively, have the relation \(\alpha_{P_1}=2\alpha_{P_2}\) by the fact that their radii are the same and their tangential acceleration are of the same ratio.

    This is a more useful formulation of what we know:

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            T_{m_1}&=am_1+\mu m_1g\\
            T_{P_1}&=\frac{Ma}{2}\\
            T_{P_2L}+T_{P_2R}&=(g-\frac{a}{2})(m_2+M)\qquad\text{this is the linear equation of the \(P_2\) and \(m_2\) system}\\
            T_{P_2L}-T_{P_2R}&=\frac{Ma}{4}\qquad\text{this is the angular equation of the \(P_2\) and \(m_2\) system}\\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Now lets look at the tensions in the string

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \draw[thick, dashed] (-8,0)node[above] {$a_{\text{String}}=0\text{ ms\(^{-2}\)}$} -- (8,0) node[right] {$String$}; % String

            \draw[->, ultra thick] (-5.5,0) -- (-8,0) node[below] {$T$}; % T
            \draw[<-, ultra thick] (-2,0)node[below] {$T_{P_2L}$} -- (-4.5,0); % TP2L
            \draw[<-, ultra thick] (-1,0)node[below] {$T_{P_2R}$} -- (1,0); % TP2R
            \draw[->, ultra thick] (3,0) -- (4,0)node[below] {$T_{P_1}$}; % TP1
            \draw[->, ultra thick] (7,0) -- (8,0)node[below] {$T_{m_1}$}; % Tm1

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    (Note: We know that the acceleartion of the string is \(0\) as the string is stationary at the ceiling and as it is inextensible and isn't in compression anywhere it hance cannot accelerate into itself.)

    \vspace{12pt}

    From this illistration it is clear that given the forces are ballenced due to the zero acceleration that:

    \[T+T_{P_2R}=T_{P2L}+T_{P_1}+T_{m_1}\]

    Hence:
    
    \begin{equation}
        \label{noLinearAccelerationEqu}
        T=T_{P2L}-T_{P_2R}+T_{P_1}+T_{m_1}=\frac{3}{4}Ma+m_1a+\mu m_1 g
    \end{equation}

    (Note: This is equation is making use of the angular equation of the \(P_2\) and \(m_1\) system so now our aim is going to be to find a way to make use of the linear equation of the same system.)
    
    \vspace{12pt}
    
    Now to get our final equation note that the implosive and explosive forces on the string must balence everywhere, as the string is inextensible so cannot be streching. Thus if you look at the ends of the string you get the above equation, however if you look at \(P_2\) the implosive forces are: \(T_{P_2L}\), and \(T_{P_2R}\); whilst the explosive forces are: \(T\), \(T_{P_1}\), and \(T_{m_1}\). Hence we are left with the equations. This allows us to make use of our knowledge of \( T_{P_2L}+T_{P_2R}=(g-\frac{a}{2})(m_2+M)\), and allow us to solve for a. Hence:

    \begin{equation}
        \label{implosionExplosionEqu}
        T+T_{P_1}+T_{m_1}=T_{P_2L}+T_{P_2R}=(g-\frac{a}{2})(m_2+M)
    \end{equation}

    And thus by (\ref{noLinearAccelerationEqu}) and (\ref{implosionExplosionEqu}) we get:

    \begin{equation*}
        \frac{3}{4}Ma+m_1a+\mu m_1 g=(g-\frac{a}{2})(m_2+M)
    \end{equation*}

    which once rearranged gives the given answer of:

    \begin{equation*}
        a=\Bigg(\frac{m_2+M-2\mu m_1}{8m_1+2m_2+7M}\Bigg)4g
    \end{equation*}
